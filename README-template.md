## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learn on this part how to center a div with css

```css
.whitebox{ 
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%); 
    border-radius: 15px;
    position: absolute; 
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%; 
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    text-align: center; 
    width: 296px;
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue to work on my css because I still lack knowledge on this subject

### Useful resources

- [MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/) - This helped me for made a part of my css. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
